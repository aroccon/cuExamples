#### Snipsets of code that employ CUDA LIBRARIES in Fortran using openACC

Main developer: A. Roccon 

Current examples:
* 3D FFT of an 3D array in one shot (easy to extend to 1D or 2D)
* Use of cuSolverDN to solve a linear system (Dense)
* Use of cuSolverSP to solve a linear system (work in progress, no interface present)

The bash files can be used to compile the different examples
